### A. Using SSH-Keys with GitHub

Follow the following steps for using SSH-Keys to interact with your GitHub account from your local computer.

1. **Create new SSH keys**: Create a new pair of SSH keys via ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email". You will be asked the location where you would like the files to be saved. You can enter your desired location and filenames: "desired_path/ssh_keys_nkarani31_github". You will also have the option of setting a passphrase for additional security. After this step, the files 'ssh_keys_nkarani31_github' and 'ssh_keys_nkarani31_github.pub' will be created as the private and public keys, respectively.

2. **Add your public SSH key to GitHub account**: Log into your GitHub account and go to Settings > SSH and GPG keys. Click "New SSH key" or "Add SSH key". Give the key a descriptive title like "Personal laptop". Paste the public key into the "Key" field. Click "Add SSH key"** to save it. If prompted, confirm access to your GitHub account.

3. **Set the location of your private keys in the local git config file** via 'git config --local core.sshcommand "ssh -vvvv -i path_to_private_key'.

4. **Change the remote url from https to git** via 'git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repo.git'. Verify that the url is set correctly via 'git remote -v'.


After these steps, you should be able to say 'git push origin main' to push your local commits to GitHub.

### B. Additional points

1. **ssh-add**: In case you have used a passphrase, but do not wish to enter it every time, you can use **ssh-add** to enter the passphrase only once per session. **ssh-add** provides a way to securely cache and reuse your SSH private key passphrases in memory via the ssh-agent, enabling passwordless SSH authentication until the agent is terminated.

2. **Git config levels and files**
    
    a. **local**: The local config file contains settings that *only apply within that specific repository*, and are stored in a file that can be found in the repo's .git directory: '.git/config'.
    
    b. **global**: The global config file contains settings that apply *to your user account on that machine*, and are stored in the file '~/.gitconfig' in your home directory.

    c. **system**: The system config file contains settings that apply *to all users on that machine*, and are stored in the file '/etc/gitconfig'.

### C. Setting up SSH keys for two different GitHub accounts [Answer from Perplexity]

To use different SSH private keys for two GitHub accounts, you can configure your SSH settings by editing the ~/.ssh/config file.
This allows you to specify which SSH key to use for each account by creating host aliases.
Hereâ€™s how you can set it up:

    a. Generate SSH Keys: First, ensure you have generated separate SSH keys for each GitHub account. You can do this using the ssh-keygen command:
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "email1@example.com" -f "~/.ssh/id_rsa_account1"
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "email2@example.com" -f "~/.ssh/id_rsa_account2"
    Replace email1@example.com and email2@example.com with the emails associated with your GitHub accounts.
    
    b. Add SSH Keys to GitHub: Add the public keys (id_rsa_account1.pub and id_rsa_account2.pub) to their respective GitHub accounts under "SSH and GPG keys" in the account settings.

    c. Edit SSH Config File: Open or create the ~/.ssh/config file and add entries for each GitHub account:

    # Personal GitHub account
    Host github.com-account1
        HostName github.com
        User git
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_account1
        IdentitiesOnly yes

    # Work GitHub account
    Host github.com-account2
        HostName github.com
        User git
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_account2
        IdentitiesOnly yes

    In this configuration:
    Host: Use a unique alias for each account (e.g., github.com-account1 and github.com-account2).
    IdentityFile: Specify the path to the private key for each account.
    IdentitiesOnly yes: Ensures that only the specified identity file is used for authentication.

    d. Add SSH Keys to SSH Agent: Add your SSH keys to the SSH agent to manage them efficiently:
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_account1
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_account2

    e. Clone Repositories Using Host Aliases: When cloning or setting remote URLs for repositories, use the host aliases defined in your SSH config:
    bash
    git clone git@github.com-account1:username/repo.git
    git clone git@github.com-account2:username/repo.git

By following these steps, you can seamlessly manage multiple GitHub accounts with different SSH keys on the same machine. This setup allows you to specify which key to use for each account by using the host aliases defined in your SSH config file.
