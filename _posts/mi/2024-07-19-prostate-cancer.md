### Prostate Cancer 101

The [prostate gland](https://minnstate.pressbooks.pub/bbbiology/chapter/prostate-tutorial/) is a walnut-sized organ in men. It produces seminal fluid.

Prostate cancer typically grows slowly, and many cases are diagnosed before the cancer has spread beyond the prostate. This slow growth means that some men may not require immediate treatment, opting instead for active surveillance, especially if the cancer is not aggressive. However, for more aggressive forms, treatments such as surgery, radiation therapy, and hormone therapy may be necessary.

Symptoms and Diagnosis
In the early stages, prostate cancer often does not present symptoms. As the disease progresses, symptoms may include:
Difficulty urinating
Decreased urine flow
Blood in urine or semen
Painful ejaculation
Persistent pain in the back, hips, or pelvis

Diagnosis typically involves a combination of screening tests, including the Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) test and digital rectal exams (DRE). If these tests indicate potential cancer, a biopsy may be performed to confirm the diagnosis and determine the cancer's aggressiveness using the Gleason score.

Risk Factors
Several factors may increase the risk of developing prostate cancer, including:
Age: Risk increases significantly after age 50.
Family history: A family history of prostate cancer can elevate risk.
Race: African American men have a higher incidence of prostate cancer compared to men of other races.
Diet: High-fat diets and obesity may also contribute to risk.

Treatment Options
Treatment strategies for prostate cancer depend on the stage and aggressiveness of the disease. Common approaches include:
Active Surveillance: Monitoring the cancer closely without immediate treatment.
Surgery: Radical prostatectomy involves the removal of the prostate gland and some surrounding tissue.
Radiation Therapy: This can be external beam radiation or brachytherapy (internal radiation).
Hormone Therapy: Used to reduce levels of male hormones that can fuel cancer growth.
Chemotherapy: Typically reserved for advanced stages of cancer.
Immunotherapy and Targeted Therapy: Emerging treatments that harness the body's immune system or target specific cancer cell characteristics.
